Part IV.

  Is mergesort stable?  
  Why or why not?
  No, my mergeSortedQueues enqueues the second item when they're equal instead of the first. Easily fixed though.

  Is quicksort stable?  
  Why or why not?
Yes, my partition method just dequeues and enqueues in the same order even if they are equal.
